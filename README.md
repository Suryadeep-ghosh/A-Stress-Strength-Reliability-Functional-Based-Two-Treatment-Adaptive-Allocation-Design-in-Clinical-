# A Stress-Strength Reliability Functional-Based Two-Treatment Adaptive Allocation Design in Clinical Trial
In this project a Two Treatment Adaptive Allocation rule based on stress-strength reliability functionals is proposed, Analysis of it's allocation proportions in different scenarios are done and some Testing Procedures are discussed. The project contains detailed explanation of the algorithm, simulated results from R, visualizations and consequential inferences.
